## Motivations
The main goal behind this project is to learn how to write better code in general.
Though I had in the last 3 years, at university, been learning about:
 - Frameworks
 - SOLID principles
 - Design patterns 

I still find myself lacking practice as I often make bad design/coding mistakes,
mistakes that could be avoided if experienced a bit more.

## Resource used
Though the code was updated a bit, the code mainly provides from a video on Youtube.
