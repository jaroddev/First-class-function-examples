## Motivations
The main goal behind this project is to learn how to write better code in general.
Though I had very recently, at university, in the last 3 years.
been learning about:
 - SOLID principles
 - Design patterns 
 - Frameworks
I still find myself lacking practice as I often make bad design/coding mistakes,
mistakes that could be avoided if experienced a bit more.

## Resource used
Though the code was updated a bit, the code mainly provides from a video on Youtube.
